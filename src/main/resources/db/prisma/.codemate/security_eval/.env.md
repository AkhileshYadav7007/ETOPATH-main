## Security Vulnerability Report

### Source Code
```python
# Standard PostgreSQL connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/etopath?schema=public"
```

---

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Hardcoded Database Credentials**
   - The username (`postgres`) and password (`postgres`) are hardcoded directly in the source code.
   - **Risk**: If this code is shared, committed to version control (e.g., Git), or exposed, attackers could gain access to the database.
   - **Recommendation**: Store credentials in secure environment variables or a dedicated secrets manager, and access them at runtime.

2. **Use of Default/PostgreSQL Superuser Credentials**
   - The username and password are both set to the default value (`postgres`), which is a well-known default configuration.
   - **Risk**: Attackers routinely attempt default credential pairs to gain unauthorized access.
   - **Recommendation**: Use a strong, unique password and create a dedicated database user account with the principle of least privilege instead of using the superuser account.

3. **No Transport Layer Security (TLS)**
   - The connection string does not specify any SSL or TLS parameters to encrypt the database connection.
   - **Risk**: If deployed in non-local environments, sensitive data (including credentials) can be transmitted in plaintext, susceptible to interception (Man-in-the-Middle attacks).
   - **Recommendation**: Enforce encrypted connections to the database (e.g., `sslmode=require`).

4. **Potential Exposure of Sensitive Information**
   - If this code is logged, output in error messages, or accidentally printed, the sensitive DATABASE_URL including username and password can be leaked.
   - **Risk**: Increases the attack surface for credential compromise and lateral movement.
   - **Recommendation**: Mask or redact sensitive environment variables in logs and error reporting.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                         | Risk Level | Recommendation                                              |
|----------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded credentials                  | High       | Use environment variables/secrets management                |
| Use of default/superuser credentials   | High       | Use strong, unique, least-privilege user credentials        |
| No encrypted connection (TLS/SSL)      | High       | Require encrypted database connections (`sslmode=require`)  |
| Risk of credential leakage in logs     | Medium     | Mask database URLs in error messages and logs               |
