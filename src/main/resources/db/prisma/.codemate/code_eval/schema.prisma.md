# Prisma Schema Code Review Report

---

## General Feedback

- Overall, the schema is fairly well organized and makes good use of Prisma's mapping and data type features.
- However, there are several points for potential improvement and correction, including naming conventions, optimizations, relation integrity, and ensuring schema constraints meet industry best practices.

## Model-Specific Review

### 1. **Consistency in Nullability and Lengths**

#### Issue:
- Some fields have no explicitly defined nullability but should be nullable for flexibility.
- Lengths of the password (100 chars) may not be robust for certain future password hash algorithms.
- `address` in User is missing explicit length/nullable options.

#### Suggestions (Pseudocode):

```prisma
// User
address   String?    @db.VarChar(255)
// Ideally, passwords should have longer length limits
password  String     @db.VarChar(255)
```
---

### 2. **Missing Relation Constraints**

#### Issue:
- Some foreign key fields allow NULL by default but are not typed as nullable.
- Not all foreign keys have explicit `onDelete`/`onUpdate` rules, risking orphaned records.

#### Suggestions (Pseudocode):

```prisma
// Always set onDelete for child refs
@relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
@relation(fields: [orderId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
@relation(fields: [courseId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
```
---

### 3. **Redundant/Unoptimized Fields/Indexes**

#### Issue:
- Both `createdAt` and `updatedAt` use `now()` as default, but updatedAt should automatically update on modification.

#### Suggestions (Pseudocode):

```prisma
// Use updatedAt: @updatedAt attribute for automatic updates
updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt @map("updated_at")
```
---

### 4. **Data Integrity and Uniqueness**

#### Issue:
- Some unique constraints could be redundant or missing for ensuring consistency.
- User phone numbers may need to be unique.

#### Suggestions (Pseudocode):

```prisma
// Add at model level if required
@@unique([phone])
```
---

### 5. **Currency Code Best Practice**

#### Issue:
- `currency` is defined as "INR" by default, but storing 3-character currency codes is best as Enum.

#### Suggestions (Pseudocode):

```prisma
enum Currency {
  INR
  USD
  EUR
  // etc.
}
// In model
currency Currency @default(INR) @db.VarChar(3)
```
---

### 6. **Status Fields as Enumerations**

#### Issue:
- Several status fields use String type but are actually enums.

#### Suggestions (Pseudocode):

```prisma
// Example for Order status
enum OrderStatus {
  CREATED
  PAID
  FAILED
  CANCELLED
  // etc.
}
status OrderStatus @default(CREATED) @db.VarChar(20)
```
---

### 7. **Potential for Data Redundancy**

#### Issue:
- `originalPrice` and `fee` in Course are both required, which can be unclear. Is both always needed?

#### Suggestions:
- Consider making one optional, or add business logic comments.

---

## Additional Best Practices

- **Use `@@index` for frequently queried fields (e.g., email, userId, courseId) for improved performance.**
- **Document each model briefly.**  
  ```prisma
  /// User table stores platform users.
  model User { ... }
  ```

## Summary Table of Corrections

| Issue                        | Suggested Correction (Pseudocode)                  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Unoptimized updatedAt fields | updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt @map("updated_at")   |
| Not using enums for status   | status OrderStatus @default(CREATED) @db.VarChar(20)|
| Not using enums for currency | currency Currency @default(INR) @db.VarChar(3)     |
| Missing onDelete             | @relation(..., onDelete: Cascade)                  |
| Address field length         | address String? @db.VarChar(255)                   |
| Password length              | password String @db.VarChar(255)                   |
| Unique phone                 | @@unique([phone])                                  |
| Documenting models           | /// User table stores ...                          |
| Add needed indexes           | @@index([userId])                                  |
