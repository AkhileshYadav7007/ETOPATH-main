# Security Vulnerability Report

**Scope:** Analysis of the provided SQL schema for security vulnerabilities.  
**Focus:** Data protection, authentication, authorization, privacy, and best practices.

---

## 1. Password Storage

**Issue:**  
```sql
password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
```
- The `password` field in `users` table is VARCHAR, implying passwords might be stored in plaintext or weakly hashed.

**Risk:**  
- Storing passwords in plaintext or with weak hash algorithms exposes them if the database is compromised.

**Recommendation:**  
- Always store password hashes, not plaintext. Apply a dedicated password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).  
- Do not store passwords in a column intended for raw text or insufficient length for strong hashes.

---

## 2. Insufficient Data Validation / Data Type Risks

**Issue:**  
- Most user input fields use VARCHAR or TEXT with generous lengths (e.g., email, address, name, city, etc.).

**Risk:**  
- Could allow attackers to inject data (for SQL Injection) or store excessive, malicious content.

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement strong input validation and length constraints at the application layer.  
- Use CHECK constraints or domain types where possible for stricter data validation.

---

## 3. Sensitive Data Exposure

**Issue:**  
- Sensitive PII (email, phone, address, WhatsApp, etc.) is stored in the `users` table.

**Risk:**  
- If the database or backups are not properly encrypted, or access control is weak, this data is at risk.

**Recommendation:**  
- Encrypt sensitive columns or the entire database at rest using built-in DBMS features or application-level encryption.
- Restrict access to the database at both DBMS and OS level.

---

## 4. Lack of Auditing Fields

**Issue:**  
- No fields for tracking last login, failed login attempts, or account lockout status.

**Risk:**  
- Inability to detect or respond to brute-force or abuse attacks.

**Recommendation:**  
- Add fields (or an audit table) to log login attempts, IP addresses, timestamps, and account lockouts.

---

## 5. Role Management

**Issue:**  
```sql
role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USER'
```
- Arbitrary string role.

**Risk:**  
- No constraints or enforced enumerations can lead to privilege escalation if an attacker inserts/updates this value.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use an ENUM type for roles or create a lookup table for valid roles, enforcing referential integrity. 
- Application logic must enforce strict checks before changing roles.

---

## 6. Uniqueness and Primary Key Choice

**Issue:**  
- The `courses` table uses VARCHAR(50) as PRIMARY KEY.

**Risk:**  
- If course IDs are user-controlled or predictable, this can lead to enumeration or IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) issues.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use BIGSERIAL or UUIDs for primary keys, especially for exposing these IDs to external interfaces.

---

## 7. Unencrypted Payment Identifiers

**Issue:**  
- Payment and order IDs (razorpay_payment_id, razorpay_order_id) are stored in plain VARCHAR fields.

**Risk:**  
- Leaks can facilitate payment fraud or replay attacks if not managed securely.

**Recommendation:**  
- Treat these as sensitive information, and avoid logging or exposing them unnecessarily.
- Alternatively, encrypt these fields if possible.

---

## 8. General Lack of Access Control/Row-Level Security

**Issue:**  
- No policy prevents one user accessing another user's data.

**Risk:**  
- Direct SQL queries or misconfigured ORM may allow privilege escalation or data leakage.

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement row-level security (RLS) in supported databases.
- Enforce user ownership in application logic.

---

## 9. No Tracking of Data Modifiers

**Issue:**  
- `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps are present, but no field tracks which user performed a change.

**Risk:**  
- Harder to audit unauthorized access or changes in the event of breach.

**Recommendation:**  
- Add fields like `created_by`, `updated_by` (containing user ID or system process reference).

---

## 10. SQL Injection Protection (Schema-Level)

**Note:**  
While not directly vulnerable at schema-level, reliance on raw integer, text, and varchar fields emphasizes the critical need for prepared statements in the application code.

**Recommendation:**  
- Always use parameterized queries / prepared statements.
- Enforce strong input validation patterns client-side and server-side.

# Conclusion

The schema as written contains several security vulnerabilities and omits best practices for protecting sensitive data and user accounts.  
**Most critical:**
- Password storage,
- PII protection,
- Role/authorization management,
- Enforcing proper access controls.

**Action:**  
Review and update both the schema and associated application code to follow best security practices as described above.
