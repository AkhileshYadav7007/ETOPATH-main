High-Level Documentation of the Code

Overview:
The code provided implements a solution to a specific programming problem. It utilizes standard data structures and algorithms to process input, perform computation, and produce the required output. The structure and logic are organized into functions/classes for clarity and modularity.

Main Components:

1. Input Handling:
   - The code reads input either from the command line, standard input, or a file.
   - Input data is parsed and structured (e.g., lists, dictionaries) as required for further processing.

2. Core Logic/Algorithm:
   - The main algorithm is implemented using appropriate data structures (such as arrays, sets, stacks, or queues).
   - Logical operations, loops, and conditionals are used to manipulate the data and compute results.
   - There may be the use of helper functions or methods to encapsulate repetitive or modular tasks.

3. Output Generation:
   - Results of computation are formatted according to the problem specification.
   - The output is printed or returned to the caller, ensuring compliance with the expected output format.

4. Error Handling (if any):
   - The code may include checks for invalid input or exceptions to ensure robustness.

Design Considerations:

- Readability: Code is structured in functions/classes with clear variable names for maintainability.
- Efficiency: Uses optimal algorithms and data structures to ensure good performance.
- Extensibility: Functions and classes can be reused or extended for related problems.

Usage:
- Execute the script as a standalone program or integrate its functions into a larger project.
- Modify input parsing or core logic as needed to adapt to similar types of problems.

Summary:
This code provides a clean, modular approach to solving a computational problem, balancing clarity, efficiency, and good software engineering practices.
