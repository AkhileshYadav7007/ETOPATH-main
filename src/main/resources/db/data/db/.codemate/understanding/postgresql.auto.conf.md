**High-Level Documentation**

This file serves as an auto-generated configuration file for a system, likely a database management system such as PostgreSQL. It contains important system settings that are managed by the system itself. Users are warned not to manually edit this file, as any manual changes will be lost when the system settings are modified using a special administrative command (`ALTER SYSTEM`). All updates to the configuration must be performed using the appropriate command-line or administrative interface provided by the system. This ensures system integrity and prevents configuration drift or corruption.
