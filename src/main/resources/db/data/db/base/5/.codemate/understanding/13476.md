**High-Level Documentation**

This code defines a program or module that handles specific computational tasks. It takes input, processes data according to a defined logic, and produces output. The main components include:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads input values, which may be provided directly by the user or retrieved from a file or another source.
2. **Data Processing/Computation**: The core functionality involves processing the input data. This typically includes iterating over the data, performing calculations, applying conditions, and possibly manipulating collections or data structures.
3. **Result Generation**: After processing, the code generates and formats results for output. This may involve converting data to strings, aggregating results, or handling edge cases.
4. **Output**: The results are output to the user, typically printed to the console or written to a file, depending on the context.

Additional features of the code might include error handling, use of functions for modularity, and comments documenting the logic. The overall design emphasizes clarity, efficiency, and correctness of the implemented algorithm or workflow.
