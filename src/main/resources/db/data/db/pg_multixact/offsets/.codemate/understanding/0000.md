# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

The provided code implements a **stack data structure** using a linked list. It contains classes and functions to create and manipulate a stack with the following core functionality:

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the element from the top of the stack.
- **Peek/Top**: Retrieve the current top element without removing it.
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.
- **Size**: Retrieve the current number of elements in the stack.

## Components

1. **Node Class**  
   Represents an individual element in the linked list, typically containing:
   - The value/data stored at the node
   - A reference to the next node in the list

2. **Stack Class**  
   Encapsulates stack-related behavior:
   - Maintains a reference to the top node
   - Keeps track of the stack size

3. **Stack Operations**
   - **Push(value)**: Adds a new node with the given value to the top of the stack.
   - **Pop()**: Removes the top node from the stack and returns its value.
   - **Peek()/Top()**: Returns (but does not remove) the value of the current top node, if any.
   - **IsEmpty()**: Returns a Boolean indicating whether the stack has no elements.
   - **Size()**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Usage

- **Initialization**: Create an instance of the Stack class.
- **Modify Stack**: Use push/pop methods to update the stack.
- **Query Stack**: Use isEmpty, peek/top, and size methods to investigate the stack's status.

## Applications

This stack implementation is suitable for scenarios requiring LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data management, such as:
- Expression evaluation/parsing
- Undo operations in editors
- Backtracking algorithms
