This code defines a Discord bot using the nextcord libraryâ€”a Python implementation compatible with Discord's API. The bot is configured with a specific command prefix and token from environment variables for secure credential management. Upon starting, the bot announces its presence in the console and sets a custom status message to display its activity on Discord.

The bot provides the following core functionalities:

1. **Greeting Command**:  
   Users can invoke a specific command to receive a friendly greeting from the bot in the Discord channel.

2. **Echo Command**:  
   The bot can repeat back any message provided by the user via a command, effectively acting as an echo utility.

3. **Error Handling**:  
   If users enter unknown commands, the bot gracefully responds with a help message, informing them that the command does not exist.

4. **Presence Management**:  
   When the bot starts, it sets its visible presence on Discord, showing a custom message to indicate it is online and ready to interact.

Overall, the code demonstrates a basic but effective structure for a Discord bot, focusing on command handling, user interaction, and responsive feedback for a smooth user experience.
