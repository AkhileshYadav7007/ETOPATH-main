**High-Level Documentation: PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration**

---

### Overview
This file, commonly named `pg_hba.conf`, defines how PostgreSQL controls client authentication. It specifies which users can connect, from which hosts, using which authentication methods, and which databases they can access.

---

### Main Functions & Structure

- **Purpose:**  
  - Manages access control and authentication for PostgreSQL server connections.

- **Record Types:**  
  - Each line specifies an authentication record with fields including connection type, database, user, address, authentication method, and optional options.

#### Connection Types:
- `local`: Unix domain socket (local machine only)
- `host`: TCP/IP connection (IPv4 or IPv6)
- `hostssl`: Encrypted TCP/IP with SSL
- `hostnossl`: Unencrypted TCP/IP
- `hostgssenc`: TCP/IP with GSSAPI encryption
- `hostnogssenc`: TCP/IP without GSSAPI encryption

#### Field Descriptions:
- **DATABASE**: Names databases to allow, keywords like `all`, `sameuser`, regular expressions, or lists.
- **USER**: Who can connect; individual names, groups, or lists.
- **ADDRESS**: Which client IPs/hostnames can connect (for TCP/IP).  
- **METHOD**: Authentication method, e.g. `trust`, `md5`, `scram-sha-256`, etc.
- **OPTIONS**: Optional, method-specific parameters.

---

### Example Records from This File

- **Local "trust" connections** (no password required) allowed on Unix socket and localhost (IPv4/IPv6).
- **Replication connections** from localhost with "trust" for users with replication rights.
- **scram-sha-256** (password-based, encrypted) required for all other hosts.

---

### Security Notes

- **"trust"** method allows any user on the matched system to connect without a passwordâ€”secure only for development/local cases.
- For production or networked environments, use strong authentication (e.g., `scram-sha-256`).

---

### Reloading Configuration

- Changes require reloading PostgreSQL configuration using SIGHUP, `pg_ctl reload`, or `SELECT pg_reload_conf()`.

---

### Inclusion Mechanism

- Additional files and directories of records can be included using `include`, `include_if_exists`, or `include_dir` statements.

---

### Rule Matching

- Rules are evaluated top-to-bottom; the first matching rule applies.

| local | replication  | all  |              | trust            | Local replication connections   |
| host  | replication  | all  | 127.0.0.1/32 | trust            | Localhost replication           |
| host  | replication  | all  | ::1/128      | trust            | IPv6 localhost replication      |
| host  | all          | all  | all          | scram-sha-256    | All other hosts require SCRAM   |
