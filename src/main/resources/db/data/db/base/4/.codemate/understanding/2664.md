## High-level Documentation

This code defines a collection of database index schemas for a relational database system, most likely PostgreSQL. Each entry associates a unique identifier (numeric and textual) with the name of an index, presumably for internal system catalog tables. The primary goal is to store and manage metadata about the available indexes for different system tables, aiding in efficient query planning and data integrity enforcement.

### Key Features

- **Index Definitions:** Each entry represents a unique index (such as a primary key or unique constraint) on internal system tables like `pg_class`, `pg_type`, `pg_attribute`, `pg_authid`, etc.
- **Index Types:** Supports various index structures (e.g., B-tree), as indicated by the naming and use of composite columns.
- **System Catalog Coverage:** Lists indexes for tables that store metadata about tables, namespaces, types, operators, procedures, conversions, triggers, and extensions.
- **Quick Access:** Provides mechanisms for quick lookup by critical fields (e.g., OIDs, names, composite keys).
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures uniqueness and referential integrity in system metadata.
- **Scalability:** Support for complex and compound indexes, enabling efficient access even as the catalog grows.

### Typical Usage

- **System Bootstrapping:** Used during database startup or catalog initialization, ensuring all required indexes are present for metadata tables.
- **Catalog Management:** Enables the database system to efficiently locate and update system metadata associated with schemas, tables, users, functions, etc.
- **Query Optimization:** Provides fast lookup paths for the query planner/executor during SQL statement processing.

### Example Indexes Listed

- `pg_class_oid_index`: Index on the OID (object identifier) for the table catalog.
- `pg_type_typname_nsp_index`: Index on the type name and namespace for the type catalog.
- `pg_proc_proname_args_nsp_index`: Index over function/procedure name, arguments, and namespace.
- `pg_namespace_nspname_index`: Index on the schema/namespace name.

### Summary

This code acts as a static reference or mapping for the crucial indexes in a relational database's internal system catalog, vital for both performance and correctness of catalog operations. It is foundational for database administration, system catalog updates, and efficient query processing.
