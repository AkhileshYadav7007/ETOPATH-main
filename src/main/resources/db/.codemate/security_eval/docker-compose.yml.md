# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the provided Docker Compose configuration for potential security vulnerabilities. The configuration consists of two services: `db` (PostgreSQL) and `adminer`.

---

## 1. Hardcoded Credentials

**Vulnerability:**
- The `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` are both hardcoded (`Akhilesh`), and the password is identical to the username, making it easy to guess.
- Credentials are specified in the Docker Compose file, which may be committed to version control and exposed publicly or to unauthorized users.

**Recommendations:**
- Use environment variables in a separate, non-versioned `.env` file or Docker secrets to manage sensitive credentials.
- Never use weak or default credentials, especially for administrator/root users.
- Enforce strong, unique passwords for database users.

---

## 2. Exposed Database Port

**Vulnerability:**
- The PostgreSQL port is mapped to the host using `${DB_PORT}:5432`. If `${DB_PORT}` is a publicly accessible port, it makes your PostgreSQL database exposed to the public internet, increasing the risk of brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.

**Recommendations:**
- Do not expose database ports directly to the public internet. Instead, use Docker networks for inter-service communication, or restrict the host mapping to localhost (e.g., `127.0.0.1:${DB_PORT}:5432`).
- Ensure firewall rules block external access to database ports.

---

## 3. Lack of Database Encryption and SSL

**Vulnerability:**
- There is no indication that connections to PostgreSQL are encrypted (e.g., using SSL/TLS).

**Recommendations:**
- Configure PostgreSQL to require SSL connections for client authentication, especially if connections are made from outside the Docker network.
- Store and mount SSL certificates securely in the container.

---

## 4. Persistence Volume & Data Exposure

**Vulnerability:**
- The database data is mounted via a volume (`./data/db:/var/lib/postgresql/data`), which may leak sensitive data if the host directory is not securely protected.
- If the host system is compromised, unencrypted database files may be copied or tampered with.

**Recommendations:**
- Restrict permissions of host volume directories to minimize unauthorized access.
- Consider encrypting data at rest, either via database settings or filesystem encryption.

---

## 5. Adminer Web Interface Exposure

**Vulnerability:**
- Adminer is exposed at port `8080:8080` with no authentication or access controls detailed in the configuration.
- This allows anyone who can access the host on port 8080 to access the Adminer interface and potentially connect to the database.

**Recommendations:**
- Avoid exposing Adminer to public interfaces; bind to localhost only or secure behind a reverse proxy with authentication.
- Consider deploying Adminer only in trusted networks or with additional authentication mechanisms.

---

## 6. Absence of Resource Isolation & Restrictive Policies

**Observation:**
- No resource limits (CPU, memory), user specification (`user:` directives), or seccomp/apparmor profiles have been set.
- Running containers as root (default) may increase risks if a container is compromised.

**Recommendations:**
- Use Docker security options to minimize privileges (drop capabilities, user namespaces).
- Run databases as non-root users.
- Set resource limits to reduce the impact of a compromise (e.g., DoS through resource exhaustion).

---

## 7. No Network Segmentation

**Vulnerability:**
- No custom Docker network is specified, leading to possible communication with other containers on the default network.

**Recommendations:**
- Use a custom, isolated bridge network for communication between only the necessary services.

| Issue                        | Severity | Recommendation                                   |
|------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded credentials        | High     | Use environment files/secrets, strong passwords  |
| Insecure port exposure (db)  | High     | Bind to localhost, use firewall rules            |
| Insecure port exposure (Adminer) | High | Bind to localhost, restrict Adminer access       |
| Lack of encryption (in transit / at rest) | Medium | Enable SSL/TLS, encrypt data files            |
| Persistent storage exposure  | Medium   | Secure host folders, encrypt at rest             |
| Default user (root)          | Medium   | Set custom user, drop privileges                 |
| Lack of network segmentation | Medium   | Use custom Docker networks                       |

# Recommendations

- Remove sensitive information from the source file and use external, secure secret management.
- Never use weak, default, or repeated credentials, especially in production environments.
- Restrict network exposure of both the database and admin tools.
- Enable in-transit and at-rest encryption where applicable.
- Limit containers' privileges and run with least privilege.
- Use resource limits and proper container isolation.

**Note:** Failing to address these security vulnerabilities could result in unauthorized database access, data breaches, and potential compromise of your host system.
