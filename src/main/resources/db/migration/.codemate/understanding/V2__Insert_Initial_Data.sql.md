# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This code consists of SQL `INSERT` statements for populating a database with information related to courses offered for e-commerce sellers. It covers course definitions, their features, and the marketplaces they target. The script assumes the existence of three tables: `courses`, `course_features`, and `course_marketplaces`.

## Components

### 1. Courses

- **Table:** `courses`
- **Purpose:** Stores the details of each course, including a unique identifier, name, description, duration, fee, original price, and intended skill level.
- **Examples:**  
  - "Starter Track" for beginners setting up their first store  
  - "Growth Track" for intermediate sellers expanding to multiple platforms  
  - "Pro Track" for advanced entrepreneurs building long-term brands

### 2. Course Features

- **Table:** `course_features`
- **Purpose:** Associates specific features or benefits with each course.
- **Usage:**  
  - Several features (e.g., live training, analytics, logistics) are linked with the respective courses.
  - Each feature is connected by the course's identifier.

### 3. Course Marketplaces

- **Table:** `course_marketplaces`
- **Purpose:** Indicates which online marketplaces are covered or supported in each course.
- **Usage:**  
  - "Starter Track" focuses on Amazon India.  
  - "Growth Track" covers Amazon India and Flipkart.  
  - "Pro Track" includes major Indian and global platforms like Amazon.in, Flipkart, Meesho, and Amazon Global.

## Workflow

1. **Insert Courses:** Adds records for each course with detailed information.
2. **Insert Course Features:** Lists features for each course, allowing for extensibility and clear course differentiation.
3. **Insert Marketplaces:** Specifies which e-commerce sites are relevant for each course.

## Use Case

This code is intended for e-commerce education or coaching platforms where course offerings, their benefits, and coverage of online marketplaces must be maintained and displayed dynamically (e.g., on a website or admin panel). It enables efficient querying by course, feature, or marketplace.

---

## Extensibility

- New courses, features, or marketplaces may be added easily by inserting additional rows.
- The structure supports filtering and showcasing features and marketplace support for each course without code changes.

---

## Assumptions

- Primary/foreign key relationships are properly mapped in the database schema.
- The tables already exist with appropriate structure.

---

## Summary

The script initializes core course information, their distinguishing features, and the marketplaces addressed by each course, supporting modular and scalable e-commerce education data management.
