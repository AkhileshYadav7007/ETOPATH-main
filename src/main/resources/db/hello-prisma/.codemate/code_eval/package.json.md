# Code Review Report for `package.json`

### 1. Missing `dependencies` Section

**Issue:**  
Production/runtime dependencies should be separated from development dependencies. Currently, there is no `"dependencies"` section.

**Suggested Correction:**  
Add a `"dependencies"` section if your app has runtime dependencies (e.g., `@prisma/client` for Prisma usage):

```pseudo
"dependencies": {
  "@prisma/client": "^5.10.2"
}
```

### 2. Missing Required Metadata

**Issue:**  
Fields such as `author`, `description`, and meaningful `keywords` are missing. These enhance discoverability and maintainability.

**Suggested Correction:**  

```pseudo
"author": "YOUR_NAME <EMAIL>",
"description": "A project demonstrating Prisma ORM integration",
"keywords": ["prisma", "typescript", "ORM"],
```

---

### 3. Incomplete `scripts` Section

**Issue:**  
Only a default placeholder for test script is provided. Industry standards recommend at least scripts for starting, building, and developing the app, especially when using TypeScript and Prisma.

**Suggested Correction:**  

```pseudo
"scripts": {
  "dev": "tsx index.ts",
  "build": "tsc",
  "start": "node dist/index.js",
  "prisma:generate": "prisma generate",
  "prisma:migrate": "prisma migrate dev",
  "test": "jest"
}
```
*(adjust as per actual entry points, test runner, folder names)*

### 4. License Field

**Issue:**  
The `"license"` field is present as `"ISC"`. Confirm that this matches your intended licensing. For open-source projects, MIT is more common.

**Suggested Correction (Optional):**

```pseudo
"license": "MIT"
```

---

### 5. Version Pinning and Consistency

**Issue:**  
The versions use caret (`^`), which can allow incompatible updates. Consider using tilde (`~`) or exact versions for production stability.

**Suggestion (Optional, for stricter version control):**

```pseudo
"devDependencies": {
  "@types/node": "~24.0.3",
  "prisma": "~5.10.2",
  "tsx": "~4.20.3",
  "typescript": "~5.8.3"
}
```

---

### 6. Main Entry Point

**Issue:**  
`main` is set to `"index.js"`, but with TypeScript builds, output is likely in `/dist`. Update accordingly (if following standard build output).

**Suggested Correction:**  

```pseudo
"main": "dist/index.js"
```

|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| dependencies    | No dependencies section                            | `"dependencies": {...}`                                   |
| metadata        | Missing author/description/keywords                | `"author": ...`, `"description": ...`, `"keywords": [...]`|
| scripts         | Only placeholder `test` script                     | Dev/build/start/prisma scripts as above                   |
| license         | ISC may not match intent                           | `"license": "MIT"`                                        |
| versions        | Version range is loose (optional)                  | Use `~` or lock with exact versions                       |
| main            | Points to wrong file if build output is in /dist   | `"main": "dist/index.js"`                                 |

**General Recommendation:**  
Ensure your `package.json` clearly separates runtime and development dependencies, provides meaningful scripts, and contains essential project metadata for sustainable development and easier onboarding.
