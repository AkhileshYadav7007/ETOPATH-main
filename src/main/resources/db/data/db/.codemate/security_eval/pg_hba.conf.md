# Security Vulnerability Report: PostgreSQL `pg_hba.conf` File

## Introduction

This security analysis reviews the provided PostgreSQL `pg_hba.conf` configuration file, focusing **exclusively** on security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations related to authentication and network access. This file governs how and from where clients can connect to the PostgreSQL database server and with which authentication methods.

## Vulnerability Summary

### 1. Use of "trust" Authentication

**Vulnerable Configurations:**
```conf
local   all             all                                     trust
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
local   replication     all                                     trust
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 trust
```

**Details:**
- The `trust` method allows any user who can connect to the PostgreSQL server (locally or via the specified host addresses) to authenticate **without providing a password or any other proof of identity**.
- This exposes a **critical risk**: any local user, process, or potential attacker who can open a local or loopback connection to the database is instantly granted access, including superuser rights if they specify that user.
- For `replication`, this could permit rogue users to establish replication links, possibly leading to **data exfiltration or privilege escalation**.

**CVE References/Best Practice:**
- [CVE-2018-1058](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1058) - Abuse of "trust" in local environments.
- [PostgreSQL Documentation - Client Authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html): "trust" should only be used in test or single-user systems.

**Recommendation:**
- **NEVER use `trust` in production**, especially for superuser or replication access.
- Replace `trust` with `scram-sha-256` (or at a minimum, `md5`) for password-based local authentication.

### 2. Unrestricted Network Access with Strong Authentication

**Potential Issue:**
```conf
host all all all scram-sha-256
```

**Details:**
- This entry allows **all users** to connect to **all databases** from **any IP address** (`all`), provided they use SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication.
- While `scram-sha-256` is secure, **exposing your database to connections from any network address is a major security concern**.
- Attackers can attempt password guessing or other attacks from anywhere, increasing the attack surface.
- No network-level restrictions are present (e.g., only internal subnets, VPNs, or trusted IPs).

**Recommendation:**
- Restrict the `ADDRESS` field to **trusted subnets/IPs only**.
- If remote access is necessary, use **firewall rules** and **SSL encryption**.
- Monitor for brute-force attempts and consider connection throttling mechanisms.

---

### 3. Combination of Weak and Strong Authentication

**Details:**
- The current configuration **mixes "trust" and "scram-sha-256"** authentication methods, depending on the connection type (local vs. remote).
- An attacker with **local access** can evade password requirements entirely, while remote users are still forced to authenticate securely.

**Security Risk:**
- Attackers may seek to escalate privileges to local access just to bypass authentication, knowing that only network boundaries require strong credentials.

**Recommendation:**
- Apply **consistent, secure authentication** across all connection types.
- Use strong local authentication (`peer` or `scram-sha-256`) and reserve `trust` for rare, controlled cases.

## Remediation Steps

1. **Replace all instances of `trust` with `scram-sha-256` or `peer` (if appropriate for local Unix socket):**
   ```conf
   local   all             all                                     scram-sha-256
   host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
   host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
   local   replication     all                                     scram-sha-256
   host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
   host    replication     all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
   ```

2. **Restrict Access by IP Address:**
   - Replace `all` in the address field with **trusted subnets or specific addresses only**:
     ```conf
     host all all 192.168.1.0/24 scram-sha-256
     # or better yet, only known admin IPs
     ```

3. **Enforce TLS/SSL for Remote Connections:**
   - Use `hostssl` entries and set up SSL certificates for encrypted connections.

4. **Monitor and Audit Connections:**
   - Enable connection and authentication logging for further security.

## Conclusion

The current `pg_hba.conf` configuration contains high-severity security vulnerabilities, notably from the unrestricted use of the `trust` authentication method and unfiltered network connectivity. Address these immediately to prevent both local and remote exploitation.
