High-Level Documentation of the Code

Overview:
The code implements a solution to a specific computational task using a given programming language. It processes input, applies algorithmic logic, and produces output based on defined requirements.

Main Components:

1. Input Handling:
   - Accepts and parses user or system input, ensuring data is usable for further processing.

2. Core Logic:
   - Contains functions or procedures that encode the main algorithm.
   - Performs necessary computational, logical, or data manipulation tasks.
   - May use loops, conditionals, and data structures (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.) as required by the logic.

3. Output Generation:
   - Formats and sends results to the user or another system component.
   - Ensures output is clear and conforms to expected format or specifications.

Possible Features:
- Error or exception handling to maintain robustness.
- Modular code organization for clarity and reusability.
- Optimization for efficiency, such as reducing time or space complexity if needed.

Usage:
- Designed to be run as a script or integrated into a larger software project.
- Can be adapted or extended for related computational problems.
