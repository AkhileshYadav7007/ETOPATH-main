High-Level Documentation

This code is a binary data dump representing the definition of several roles and privileges in a **PostgreSQL database server**. It appears to be an internal system catalog or metadata file that lists PostgreSQL default and custom roles, along with their associated privileges and capabilities.

Key Points:

- **Roles and Privileges:**  
  The file enumerates various PostgreSQL default roles such as:
  - `pg_read_all_data`
  - `pg_write_all_data`
  - `pg_monitor`
  - `pg_checkpoint`
  - `pg_signal_backend`
  - `pg_database_owner`
  - ...and several others

- **Special System Roles:**  
  PostgreSQL ships with a set of built-in roles that grant limited superuser-like capabilities for specific administrative tasks. Examples in this dump include:
  - `pg_read_server_files`
  - `pg_write_server_files`
  - `pg_use_reserved_connections`
  - `pg_execute_server_program`
  - `pg_maintain`
  - `pg_stat_scan_tables`
  - `pg_create_subscription`

- **Custom/User-Defined Roles:**  
  The presence of a role like `Akhilesh` suggests that this binary data also includes user-created roles in addition to system-defined ones.

- **Role Attributes:**  
  For each role, various attributes are likely present in the binary data, such as:
  - Role name
  - Role OID (object identifier)
  - Role membership and grant relationships
  - Privilege flags (like can login, can create DB, inherit privileges, etc.)

- **Usage:**  
  Such data is usually part of the PostgreSQL internal system catalogs (e.g., `pg_authid`, `pg_roles`) and is used by the database engine to manage role-based access control.

- **Not Intended for Direct Edits:**  
  This file is not meant to be read or edited directly by users. Instead, SQL commands like `CREATE ROLE`, `GRANT`, alter these system files indirectly via the PostgreSQL server process.

Summary Table Example:

| Role Name                       | Purpose/Description                               |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `pg_read_all_data`               | Allows read access to all databases               |
| `pg_write_all_data`              | Allows write access to all databases              |
| `pg_monitor`                     | Allows monitoring database server                 |
| `pg_maintain`                    | Allows server maintenance operations              |
| `pg_signal_backend`              | Allows signaling/terminating server backends      |
| `pg_execute_server_program`      | Allows executing server-side programs/scripts     |
| `Akhilesh`                       | (Example of a custom user-defined role)           |

**Conclusion:**  
This file represents the low-level storage of PostgreSQL roles and privileges, essential for the databaseâ€™s authentication and authorization subsystems. It is system-generated and maintained, reflecting both out-of-the-box PostgreSQL administrative roles and any added by users or applications.
