**High-Level Documentation of the Code**

This code is a configuration file for Prisma, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool commonly used with Node.js applications to interact with databases. Its primary function is to declare environment variables, specifically the database connection string, which Prisma uses to connect to the application's database.

**Key Points:**

- **Purpose**: Specifies how Prisma connects to your chosen database.
- **DATABASE_URL**: 
  - The main variable defined is `DATABASE_URL`, containing a standard PostgreSQL connection string with placeholders for username, password, host, port, database, and schema.
  - Example: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/etopath?schema=public`
- **Alternative (Commented Out)**: 
  - A commented-out example is shown for a Prisma Accelerate connection URL, which could be used for accelerated or managed Prisma deployments.
- **Usage**: 
  - Prisma automatically reads these variables for connecting to the database during development and production.

**References**: 
- Documentation links are included for further details on Prisma schema environment variables and supported connection strings.

This file is essential for securely and flexibly managing database connections in Prisma-powered applications.
