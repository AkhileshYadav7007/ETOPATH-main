**High-Level Documentation**

This code defines a structured dataset representing various parts (modules or features) of the SQL standard, along with corresponding codes, names, and possibly additional properties such as status (e.g., "NO"). Each entry appears to represent a specific SQL specification, organized in increasing order of part number, and includes titles such as:

- Framework
- Foundation
- Call-Level Interface (SQL/CLI)
- Persistent Stored Modules (SQL/PSM)
- Management of External Data (SQL/MED)
- Object Language Bindings (SQL/OLB)
- Information and Definition Schema (SQL/Schemata)
- Routines and Types Using the Java Programming Language (SQL/JRT)
- XML-Related Specifications (SQL/XML)
- Multi-Dimensional Arrays (SQL/MDA)
- Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ)

The dataset is encoded in a compact, possibly binary format with embedded textual fields for titles and codes. Each block of data contains:

- A sequence identifier or part number
- An apparent SQL specification code (e.g., 15G, 14K, 13ï¿½, etc.)
- The human-readable title of the SQL standard component (e.g., "Framework", "Foundation", etc.)
- A status value ("NO")
- Structural markers or padding

**Overall Purpose**

The code's purpose is to enumerate and store metadata on components of the SQL language standard, possibly for use in documentation generation, UI presentation, DBMS feature reporting, or compliance checks. It does not contain computational logic, algorithms, or transformations, but instead functions as a registry or catalog of SQL parts and their metadata.
