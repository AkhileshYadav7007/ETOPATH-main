This snippet is a configuration file (likely a `.env` or environment variables file). It provides database connection parameters for a PostgreSQL database. Specifically, it sets the following values:

- **DB_HOST**: The database server address (`localhost`), meaning the database is running on the same machine as the application.
- **DB_PORT**: The port number for PostgreSQL (`5432`, which is the default).
- **DB_USER**: The username to connect to the database (`postgres`).
- **DB_PASSWORD**: The password for the database user (`postgres`).
- **DB_NAME**: The name of the database to use (`etopath`).

Applications typically read these environment variables to establish a connection to the database server. This approach is common for configuring database access without hardcoding sensitive information into the source code.
