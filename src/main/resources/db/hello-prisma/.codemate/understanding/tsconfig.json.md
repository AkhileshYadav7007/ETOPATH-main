# High-Level Documentation: TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)

This configuration file sets up the TypeScript compiler options for the project. It customizes JavaScript code generation, module handling, file emission, and type-checking behaviors to establish robust coding standards and developer ergonomics. Below is an overview of the main configuration areas in use:

---

## 1. Language and Output Settings
- **Target ECMAScript Version:**  
  `"target": "es2016"`  
  The compiler outputs ECMAScript 2016-compliant JavaScript.

## 2. Module System
- **Module Kind:**  
  `"module": "commonjs"`  
  The project uses the CommonJS module system for compatibility with Node.js runtime environments.

## 3. Compatibility and Interop
- **ES Module Interop:**  
  `"esModuleInterop": true`  
  Enables compatibility and seamless import/export between CommonJS and ES Modules.
- **Consistent File Name Casing:**  
  `"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true`  
  Ensures all import paths use consistent case sensitivity, reducing cross-platform bugs.

## 4. Type Safety and Strictness
- **Strict Type Checking:**  
  `"strict": true`  
  Turns on all strict type-checking options, maximizing code safety and reducing runtime errors.

## 5. Speed and Type Declaration
- **Skip Library Definition Checks:**  
  `"skipLibCheck": true`  
  Speeds up compilation by skipping type-checking of external declaration files (`.d.ts`), which is generally safe in most cases.

## Summary

This `tsconfig.json` describes a **strongly typed, strict TypeScript project** intended for CommonJS (Node.js) environments, emphasizing best practices, interoperability, and development speed. Most additional options are left commented, preserving flexibility and enabling further customization as needed. This configuration is well-suited for robust, maintainable backend or cross-platform projects.
