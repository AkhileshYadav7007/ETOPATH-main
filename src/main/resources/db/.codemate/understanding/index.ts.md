# High-Level Documentation

## Purpose
This code demonstrates how to use Prisma ORM to interact with a database in a Node.js application. It performs the following operations:

1. **Creates a new user** with related posts and a profile.
2. **Retrieves and displays all users** including their associated posts and profiles.
3. **Handles async program flow and cleanly disconnects Prisma** at the end or on error.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Initialization
- Imports and initializes a Prisma Client for database operations.

### 2. Main Operations (in `main()` function)
- **User Creation**:
  - Adds a new user with specific name and email.
  - Simultaneously creates an associated post and profile for the user.
- **Data Retrieval**:
  - Fetches all users, including their posts and profiles, from the database.
  - Outputs the complete user data structure to the console.

### 3. Shutdown and Error Handling
- **Graceful Disconnect**: Ensures Prisma is properly disconnected after all operations.
- **Error Handling**: Catches errors, logs them, disconnects Prisma, and exits the process with an error status.

---

## Key Concepts Used

- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database access for Node.js.
- **Data Relationships**: Creation and fetching with related entities (one user -> one profile, one user -> multiple posts).
- **Async/Await**: For handling asynchronous database operations.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures resources are properly released on success or failure.

## Usage Context

This template is ideal for:
- Setting up and seeding initial data in a database.
- Demonstrating basic CRUD (Create, Read) operations with Prisma.
- Teaching or testing data modeling with related records (users, posts, profiles).
