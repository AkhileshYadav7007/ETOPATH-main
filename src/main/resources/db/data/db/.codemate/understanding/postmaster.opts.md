**High-Level Documentation**

**Overview**  
The code `/usr/local/bin/postgres` is not traditional source code but rather a command-line invocation used to start the PostgreSQL server. This executable (`postgres`) is the primary server process of the PostgreSQL relational database management system (RDBMS).

**Purpose**  
- Launches the PostgreSQL database server instance.
- Listens for connections from PostgreSQL clients (such as `psql`, applications, etc.).
- Manages database operations including query execution, transaction processing, and data storage/retrieval.

**Key Functions**  
- Initializes shared memory and background processes required to run the database.
- Accepts and processes client queries using the SQL language.
- Handles authentication, logging, and resource management for multiple concurrent users.

**Typical Usage Scenario**  
This command is run by system service managers (such as `systemd`) or manually by the database administrator to bring up a PostgreSQL server, making databases available for application access on a given host.

**Location**  
- `/usr/local/bin/` indicates this is a locally installed version of PostgreSQL rather than a system-packaged version.

**Configuration**  
On startup, `postgres` reads its configuration files (commonly in `/usr/local/var/postgres` or as specified by command-line flags) to determine operational parameters such as data directory, networking, and authentication policies.

**Security Note**  
Because this process manages database security and data access, it is generally run under a dedicated operating system user (often `postgres`).

**Summary**  
Invoking `/usr/local/bin/postgres` starts the core server for PostgreSQL databases, initializing all supporting infrastructure required to store, manage, and provide access to relational data.
