# High-Level Documentation

## Purpose
This code provides a mapping between language codes/identifiers and their corresponding language names. It appears to be a data structure, likely used in software that supports multilingual capabilities or language selection features.

## Functionality
- The code pairs language identifiers (such as "simple", "arabic", "armenian", "basque", etc.) with their English language names.
- It supports a broad range of languages including European, Asian, and Semitic languages.
- The data appears structured for fast lookup, possibly for dropdown menus, translation utilities, or text recognition settings.

## Supported Languages
A sample of the languages included:
- Simple (possibly "Simple English")
- Arabic
- Armenian
- Basque
- Catalan
- Danish
- Dutch
- English
- Finnish
- French
- German
- Greek
- Hindi
- Hungarian
- Indonesian
- Irish
- Italian
- Lithuanian
- Nepali
- Norwegian
- Portuguese
- Romanian
- Russian
- Serbian
- Spanish
- Swedish
- Tamil
- Turkish
- Yiddish

## Typical Usage Scenarios
- A language picker in a web or desktop application.
- User profile settings, allowing a user to select their preferred language.
- Internationalization or localization routines.
- Displaying human-readable language names based on stored codes/keys.

## Limitations & Notes
- This code is primarily a data mapping; it does not include functional routines or algorithms.
- There is no indication of dynamic behavior, error handling, or localization beyond the name mapping.
- If more languages need to be supported, they can be added by extending the mapping.
