# Security Vulnerability Report

This report analyzes the provided configuration code for potential **security vulnerabilities**. All findings are limited strictly to security-related issues.

---

## 1. **Sensitive Information Exposed in Code**

### Database Credentials
```properties
spring.datasource.username=Akhilesh
spring.datasource.password=Akhilesh
```
- **Problem:** The database username and password are stored in plain text, making them easily accessible to anyone with access to the codebase or configuration.
- **Risk:** Database compromise if source is leaked.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Use environment variables or a secure secrets store/service (like AWS Secrets Manager, Hashicorp Vault, etc.).
    - Never commit secrets or credentials directly to version control.

### Razorpay API Keys (Secret Key Exposure)
```properties
razorpay.key.id=rzp_test_zL2doCmQkEPhtc
razorpay.key.secret=kRGx3dV22m7gMT1FA0wte3lu
```
- **Problem:** Both the test key ID and secret key are included in the code/configuration.
- **Risk:** Service/account compromise if secrets are leaked.
- **Mitigation:** 
    - Store API keys in environment variables or a secrets manager.
    - Never commit keys to version control or expose in public repositories.

### JWT Secret Hardcoded (Weak secret)
```properties
jwt.secret=${JWT_SECRET:etopath_jwt_secret_key_for_authentication_and_authorization}
```
- **Problem:** A default JWT secret is hardcoded if the environment variable is not set. The value appears easily guessable/predictable.
- **Risk:** Attacker could tamper with or forge JWT tokens, leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Mandate setting a strong, random secret via environment variable.
    - Avoid using a weak or default fallback value.

## 2. **Configuration Weaknesses**

### Database Connection String (Insecure Settings)
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/EPath?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
```
- **Problem:** `useSSL=false` disables SSL, so DB connections are sent unencrypted.
- **Risk:** Sensitive DB data and credentials can be intercepted over the network.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Enable SSL (`useSSL=true`) for all non-local deployments.
    - Use properly issued certificates, not self-signed (unless development).

### CORS Configuration (Potentially Overly Permissive)
```properties
cors.allowed-origins=http://localhost:3000
cors.allowed-methods=GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS
cors.allowed-headers=Authorization,Content-Type,X-Requested-With
```
- **Observation:** Only allows localhost; safe for development. **However**, ensure this isn't wider in production.
- **Risk:** If loosened (e.g., `*`), attackers could exploit CORS misconfiguration.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Review/lock down in production.
    - Never use wildcard origins in production environments.

---

## 3. **General Best Practices Lacking**

- **No 'production' profile separation:** All configuration (including secrets) is in one file. Using multiple profiles (dev, test, prod) allows for stricter separation and reduces accidental exposure.
- **Logging Sensitive Data:** Depending on actual code, enabling DEBUG for application logs could inadvertently log sensitive data. While not directly seen here, caution is warranted.

---

## 4. **Recommendations**

- **Remove all secrets from code/configuration**. Move to environment variables or secure config vault.
- **Regenerate (and rotate) any exposed keys** immediately.
- **Mandate SSL/TLS** for all database communications outside strict local development.
- **Ensure strong, random JWT secrets** and never use default/fallback secrets in production.
- **Regularly audit** all configuration for accidental exposure before deployment.

| Issue                               | Location                             | Risk Level | Suggested Fix                                 |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| DB credentials in code (plaintext)   | `spring.datasource.username/password`| High       | Use env vars or secrets management            |
| Razorpay secret in config            | `razorpay.key.secret`                | High       | Use secrets manager & remove from code        |
| JWT secret default & weak            | `jwt.secret`                         | High       | Require env var; use strong random value      |
| SSL disabled for DB                  | `useSSL=false` in DB URL             | Medium     | Enable SSL in production                      |
| CORS development value (reminder)    | `cors.allowed-origins`               | Medium     | Restrict origins in production                |

> **NOTE:** Credentials and secrets exposed in configuration files are among the most common sources of major data/regulatory breaches. Immediate action is recommended.
