Overview  
The code is designed to manage and manipulate a data set containing employee information within an organization. Its primary purpose is to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as well as filtering and sorting employees based on various attributes such as department, role, and years of experience.

Main Components  

1. Data Structure:  
Defines a list (or array) of objects, where each object represents an employee. Each employee object contains fields such as id, name, department, role, yearsOfExperience, and salary.

2. CRUD Operations:  
- Create: Adds new employee objects to the dataset with unique identifiers.
- Read: Retrieves employee data, with options to view all employees or search for a specific employee by id or other fields.
- Update: Modifies details of an existing employee, such as updating their department or role.
- Delete: Removes an employee from the dataset using their unique identifier.

3. Filtering & Sorting:  
Implements functionality to filter employees by department, role, or experience, and allows sorting the list based on fields like name or salary in ascending or descending order.

4. Utility Functions:  
Helper functions check the validity of user input, generate unique IDs, and format output for display purposes.

5. User Interaction:  
Provides an interface (command-line or web-based) for users to input their choices regarding which operation to perform and enter details as needed.

Use Cases  
- Viewing all employees in a specific department
- Adding a new employee record
- Updating or deleting an employeeâ€™s data
- Sorting employee records by salary
- Filtering employees based on years of experience

Error Handling  
Includes error checking for invalid data input and manages scenarios where the requested employee is not found during update or delete operations.

Extensibility  
The code is modular, making it easy to extend functionality, such as adding new filtering options or integrating with external databases or APIs.
