# Security Vulnerability Report

## Scanned Code
The code provided is an environment variable configuration file related to Prisma, containing database connection strings.

---

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Hardcoded Database Credentials**

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/etopath?schema=public"
```
- **Description**: The username and password for the database (`postgres:postgres`) are hardcoded in plain text within the environment file.
- **Risks**: 
  - If this file is committed to version control (e.g., Git), attackers gaining access can easily retrieve these credentials.
  - Use of default credentials (`postgres:postgres`) makes brute-force attacks trivial if the database becomes accessible from outside localhost.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Use strong, unique passwords for database users.
  - Do **not** use default credentials in any environment (even for development).
  - Store sensitive configuration in secure secret management systems or environment variables set directly in the host environment (not in repo-tracked files).
  - Add `.env` or similar files to `.gitignore`.

### 2. **Exposure of Sensitive API Key in Commented Connection String**

```env
# DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcGlfa2V5IjoiMDFKWUNOREpFQkJFR1pKNUQyUkJCVjlNNDkiLCJ0ZW5hbnRfaWQiOiJjY2NiNGU2MDlhZmNkZTdhNGUwNTBkYzJjZjVlYzVkZDhlMTZiOGViOGZmYzc0MmNmNTBjYmMyOWRiNmM4NGI2IiwiaW50ZXJuYWxfc2VjcmV0IjoiMGQxY2YzNmMtYTY2YS00MWY4LThmNzYtYjM0ZGQxNmYxYjFhIn0.KVGXPDXysQ5NInGYLv5BTxD_ODdhO02wwuiI9GiQTo4"
```
- **Description**: Even though this connection string is commented out, it contains a **valid API key** visible in plaintext in a configuration file.
- **Risks**: 
  - Commented secrets can be exposed if the file is ever shared or leaked, even if currently not in use.
  - Attackers can uncomment and use these credentials against your system.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Never store secrets in source code repositories, even in comments.
  - Use environment variables for secret management outside of code files. 
  - Regularly rotate secrets that may have been exposed or shared.

### 3. **Potential Insecure Local Development Defaults**

- **Description**: Using default credentials (`postgres:postgres`) on `localhost` may seem harmless for local development, but such patterns are frequently overlooked and end up in production.
- **Risks**:
  - If this setting propagates to production, the risk of credential compromise is severe.
  - Encourages insecure practices for contributors, risking accidental leaks.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Establish separate, environment-specific environment files.
  - Provide examples with environment variable names only (not real secrets) for contributors (`DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/db?schema=public`).
  - Set up secrets for each developer with proper access controls.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                               | Risk Level | Recommendation                              |
|----------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded credentials in plaintext           | High       | Store secrets securely and out of repo files |
| Exposed sensitive API key in comments        | High       | Remove/rotate secrets, avoid in comments     |
| Use of default ("postgres:postgres") creds   | Medium     | Enforce strong, unique passwords            |

---

## General Best Practices

- **Never commit secrets** (environment files with real values) to version control.
- **Rotate and revoke** credentials if exposure is possible or suspected.
- **Encrypt secrets** at rest and use secure secret managers (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- **Review access** and audit secret usage regularly.

## Immediate Actions to Mitigate Risks

1. **Delete sensitive files** from version control history if already committed.
2. **Rotate the exposed API key** and all related database credentials.
3. **Replace hardcoded credentials** with environment variable names or placeholders.
4. **Add `.env` and related files to `.gitignore`** to prevent future leaks.
