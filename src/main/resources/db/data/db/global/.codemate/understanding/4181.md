This code implements a command-line to-do list manager. It allows users to add, view, mark as done, and remove tasks. Key features include:

- **Task Management**: Users can add tasks with descriptions and optional due dates.
- **Completion Tracking**: Tasks can be marked as complete or incomplete.
- **Task Listing**: Users can view all tasks, filter by status (completed, pending), or search by keywords.
- **Persistence**: Task data is saved to and loaded from a file, ensuring tasks persist between sessions.
- **User Interface**: A simple text-based menu guides users through available actions.
- **Input Validation**: The application checks for valid user inputs to prevent errors.

Overall, the code provides basic but robust functionality for managing a personal to-do list from the command line.
