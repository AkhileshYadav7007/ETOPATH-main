# Code Review Report

**Code Provided:**  
`17`

---

## 1. Functionality / Correctness

- The code only consists of a single literal integer `17`.  
- **Issue:** This is not a valid implementation for most use-cases or standards, unless explicitly meant as a return value within a function, a test value, or as a placeholder.  
- **Consequence:** As written, the code does not perform any operation, is unassignable, and does not meet any typical industry standards.

---

## 2. Optimization

- **Unoptimized Implementation:**  
  - The code does not encapsulate its value, provide context, or serve any reusable purpose.
  - Single values should be used meaningfully in variables, functions, or constants.

---

## 3. Software Engineering Best Practices

- **Readability / Maintainability:**  
  - A literal value alone is not maintainable or readable in professional codebases.
  - No context, comments, or naming are present.

### Suggested Correction (Pseudocode)

```pseudo
// If '17' is meant to be a constant, use:
const VALUE = 17

// If intended as a function return:
function getValue():
    return 17
```

> **Recommendation:**  
> Encapsulate literal values in descriptive variables or as return values of functions. Do not leave stray values in codebases. Add context and comments as appropriate.

## 4. Error Handling

- N/A, as there is no mechanism here that can error.

---

## Conclusion

- The code as written does **not** adhere to industry best practices.
- Use constants, variable assignments, or functions to provide purpose and clarity.
- Document intent for all literal values.
