# High-Level Documentation

This code represents a data structure containing a list of SQL standard components and their metadata. Each entry in the list has information about a particular part of the SQL standard, such as:

- A title (e.g., "Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ)")
- An identifying code or key (e.g., 16C, 15G, 14K, etc.)
- An SQL part or feature acronym (e.g., SQL/PGQ, SQL/MDA, SQL/XML, etc.)
- A flag or status indicator (e.g., "NO")
- Ordering/index information

The SQL standard parts described here include, but are not limited to:
- Framework (SQL/Framework)
- Foundation (SQL/Foundation)
- Call-Level Interface (SQL/CLI)
- Persistent Stored Modules (SQL/PSM)
- Management of External Data (SQL/MED)
- Object Language Bindings (SQL/OLB)
- Information and Definition Schema (SQL/Schemata)
- Routines and Types using Java (SQL/JRT)
- XML-Related Specifications (SQL/XML)
- Multi-Dimensional Arrays (SQL/MDA)
- Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ)

The structure might be for use in a user interface, database, or configuration file where SQL standard modules are listed for selection, documentation, compliance checks, or feature toggling.

**Note:** The presence of non-printable, binary, and encoded data suggests that this is not just a plain text configuration, but a serialized or encoded binary object, possibly from a UI framework, application state file, or non-textual database dump.

## Intended Use

This structure is likely used to:
- Display available SQL standard modules to users
- Track or configure which SQL features are enabled or available
- Describe SQL standard modules, possibly in an administrative or educational tool

## Notable Features

- Encapsulation of SQL standard metadata
- Binary serialization for efficient storage or network transport
- Support for easy extension if more SQL modules are added in the future

## Not Covered

Due to the binary/numeric encoding, specifics of methods, user interface, or application logic are not directly represented in this snippet. This documentation covers only the high-level, conceptual intent of the data structure.
