# Security Vulnerability Report for Provided Prisma Schema

This report focuses solely on **security vulnerabilities** in the submitted Prisma schema code.

---

## 1. **Password Storage Insecure by Default**

- **Model:** User
- **Field:** `password String @db.VarChar(100)`

### Issue

Storing passwords as plain strings—even if hashed outside the schema—is risky if appropriate hashing and salting are not enforced at the application level. Prisma schema itself does not enforce or verify password security.

### Risks
- If a developer forgets to hash/salt passwords on insert/update, raw passwords will be stored.
- Potential for major data breach if the `users` table is dumped.

### Recommendations
- Make sure passwords are always hashed (bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt) before persistence.
- Consider renaming the field or annotating with a comment in the schema to indicate that *only hashes* are allowed (documentation or custom Prisma "comment").
- Use application-level middleware to strictly enforce password hashing.

---

## 2. **Sensitive Data in Environment Variables**

- **Datasource config:**  
  ```prisma
  url = env("DATABASE_URL")
  ```

### Issue

If `DATABASE_URL` is exposed (committed or leaked), attackers could access the database directly since it usually contains a username, password, host, and database name.

### Risks
- Database compromise if `.env` or deployment config is readable.

### Recommendations
- Ensure `.env` is gitignored and never exposed.
- Use secrets management systems in production (not flat env files).
- Rotate credentials regularly.

---

## 3. **Unencrypted Sensitive Columns**

- **Fields:**  
  - `User.phone`, `User.whatsapp`
  - `UserBusinessInfo.currentBusiness`, `UserBusinessInfo.goals`, etc.

### Issue

Sensitive personal and business information is stored in plaintext by default as `String`. Prisma schema does not specify or enforce column-level encryption.

### Risks
- If an attacker gains database access, sensitive PII and business info are exposed.

### Recommendations
- Consider application-level encryption for sensitive PII before storage.
- Use field encryption libraries where relevant.

---

## 4. **Wide Open Role Management**

- **Field:** `role String @default("USER") @db.VarChar(20)`
- No enum or constraint; any arbitrary string can be set.

### Issue

Free-form roles can allow privilege escalation if role assignment is improperly controlled in the code.

### Risks
- Attacker may set their role to "ADMIN" or similar by modifying API requests.

### Recommendations
- Define `role` as an [enum](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/enums) (e.g., `enum Role { ADMIN USER ... }`).
- Restrict role changes strictly via safe, admin-only logic in your application.

---

## 5. **No Auditing or Tracking of Sensitive Actions**

- There is no mechanism to record changes to sensitive fields, e.g., `password` fields and `role` fields.

### Issue

Compromises can go undetected if there is no audit trail.

### Recommendations
- Implement application-level logging (secure, append-only) for sensitive actions such as password/role changes.

---

## 6. **No Soft Deletes For Important Records**

- All deletions appear to be hard deletes (onDelete: Cascade on some relations).

### Issue

If an account is deleted (especially with onDelete: Cascade), all linked records are gone; any accidental or malicious deletion is permanent and unrecoverable, which can be abused for data destruction attacks.

### Recommendations
- Consider implementing a `deletedAt` field (soft delete) for key models (User, Order, etc.), or ensure admin processes limit destructive access.

---

## 7. **Razorpay Sensitive Identifiers**

- `razorpayOrderId`, `razorpayPaymentId`, `razorpaySignature` are stored as `String?`

### Issue

While not direct secrets, these fields may be sensitive depending on how Razorpay expects them to be used. Storing signatures unencrypted may risk replay or impersonation attacks if these values are ever misused.

### Recommendations
- Store only what is required, avoid unnecessary logging/collection of sensitive tokens, and never store raw API secrets.
- Ensure these fields are not considered "authenticators" in your business logic unless adequately protected.

---

## 8. **No Rate Limiting or Account Lockout (Out of Schema, but Related)**

While not visible in the schema, unless enforced at a higher application level, brute-force attacks (e.g., password guessing) are not prevented.

### Recommendations
- Implement rate limiting and account lockout on authentication endpoints in your application code.

# **Conclusion**

The Prisma schema shows several common security weak points, the most critical being improper password handling, lack of strict role definitions, potential PII exposure, and lack of auditing. Address these with both schema constraints (where possible) and robust application logic to mitigate risk.

**Note:** Prisma by itself does not cover all security needs; strong application-layer controls and frequent security reviews are mandatory.
