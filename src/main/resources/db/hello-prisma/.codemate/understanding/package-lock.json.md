# High-Level Documentation: `hello-prisma` Project Dependencies (`package-lock.json`)

## Overview

This file documents the dependency tree and meta-information for a Node.js project named **hello-prisma** (version 1.0.0). The file is an auto-generated `package-lock.json` that ensures consistent node module installation and dependency resolution. The project is licensed under ISC.

---

## Purpose

- **Dependency Management**: Locks exact versions of dependencies for reliable, repeatable builds.
- **Dev Environment**: The configuration is tailored for development purposes, particularly TypeScript and Prisma ORM projects.

---

## Major Components

### 1. **DevDependencies**
- **typescript** (`^5.8.3`): Provides static typing for JavaScript with TypeScript.
- **@types/node** (`^24.0.3`): TypeScript type definitions for Node.js APIs.
- **tsx** (`^4.20.3`): Runtime for TypeScript/TSX files, often used for local dev/testing.
- **prisma** (`^6.10.1`): Database toolkit/ORM for TypeScript & Node.js.

### 2. **Prisma Ecosystem**
- **@prisma/config**: Internal Prisma configuration utilities.
- **@prisma/engines**: Engines for query execution, migrations, etc.
- **@prisma/debug**: Debug utilities for Prisma.
- **@prisma/fetch-engine, get-platform, engines-version**: Helpers for dynamic engine loading and platform detection.

### 3. **Type Support & Build Utilities**
- **esbuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler with platform-specific binaries for supported architectures/OSes (see `@esbuild/*` packages).
- **get-tsconfig**: Helps locate and parse `tsconfig.json` configuration.
- **jiti**: Dynamic runtime code loading, used internally by Prisma.
- **resolve-pkg-maps**: Helper for resolving package mapping, used by build tools.

### 4. **Platform-Specific Binaries**
- **@esbuild/***: Provides binaries for esbuild tailored to various OS and CPU architectures (Linux, Windows, macOS, ARM, x64, etc.). These are optional dependencies and are only installed as needed by the host system.

---

## Dependency Relationships and Locking

- **Exact Versions**: Each dependency is locked to a specific version to avoid unexpected breakage.
- **Peer & Optional Dependencies**: Some dependencies (like TypeScript) are specified as peers for tools like Prisma, indicating that the project is expected to bring its own compatible version.
- **Engines**: Several packages specify minimum Node.js versions for compatibility.
- **Platform Handling**: Binaries are only installed if the host matches the supported OS and CPU.

---

## Usage Scenario

This configuration is typical for a **TypeScript backend project using Prisma ORM**, with tools for rapid development (tsx), fast builds (esbuild), and robust type checking.

---

## Installation & Usage

```shell
# Standard installation command (dependencies are locked to these versions)
npm ci
```

The lockfile ensures that all developers and deploy pipelines install identical dependencies, avoiding environment-specific bugs.

---

## Summary

- **hello-prisma** is setup for TypeScript-based backend development using Prisma as the ORM.
- Dependency versions, including all Prisma and build tool internals, are tightly controlled.
- Platform binaries are provisioned as optional, reducing installation bloat.
- The configuration supports reliable development, testing, and deployment pipelines for a Node.js + TypeScript + Prisma stack project.
